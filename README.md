# Weather-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
We want to explore the correlation between different weather parameters. We will also check if there is any relationship between humidity and temperature as well as humidity and apparent temperature and try to predict apparent temperature using the most important features. Finally we will calculate the accuracy of our model.
